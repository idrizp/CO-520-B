In Problem 1 of section 6.3.1, a sinusoidal wave with a frequency of 500 Hz and an amplitude of 2 Vpp was generated using the function generator, with no offset. All properties were verified using the measure function, and a hard copy was taken in the time domain. The FFT spectrum was obtained using the oscilloscope FFT function, and the properties were measured using the cursor. Hard copies were taken of the complete spectra and the zoomed spectra peak. A sinusoidal wave with a frequency of 2 KHz and an amplitude value of 0 dB spectrum peak, without a dc offset, was generated using the measure function and the cursors. Hard copies were taken of the time and frequency domain.
