% Prelab:

% Given is a series RLC resonant circuit with R = 390Î©, C = 270 nF 
% and L = 10 mH.
% 1. Name the filter characteristic measured over the different components, com-
% ponent combinations.

% 2. Show the Bode magnitude plot across the resistor, 
% the capacitor, the inductor and across the capacitor 
% and the inductor together. Use a 5 V amplitude and vary the
% frequency starting at 100 Hz up to 100 KHz.

% Develop a Matlab script to plot the four characteristic in one graph.
% Attach the script to the prelab!
% 3. Taking the magnitude across the resistance represents a band-pass filter. 
% Calculate the bandwidth and the Q factor of the circuit. 
% Extract the bandwidth from the Matlab plot and compare.

H_R = tf([R*C, 0], [L*C, R*C, 1]);
% The transfer function of the voltage taken across the resistor shows a
% bandpass filter.

H_L = tf([L*C, 0, 0], [L*C, R*C, 1]);
% The transfer function of the voltage across the inductor shows a
% high-pass filter.

H_C = tf(1,  [L*C, R*C, 1]);
% The transfer function of the voltage across the capacitor shows a
% low-pass filter.

H_LC = tf([L*C, 0, 1], [L*C, R*C, 1]);
% The transfer function of the voltage taken across the inductor and the
% capacitor shows a band-stop filter.

% Calculated bandwidth and quality factor:

%% Lab data results

% V_C hardcopy first - Low pass filter
% V_L hardcopy second - High pass filter 
% V_R hardcopy third - Band pass filter
% V_LC hardcopy fourth - Band-stop/Notch filter
% At resonance, the Lissajou is linear(a line), at 3100 Hz we see the
% Lissajou turn linear, so that must be the resonant frequency

% Phase shift: -500mDeg to 0 Deg(more conceretely, 0 deg)

% Corner frequencies: 1. 1290Hz  2. 7640Hz
