%% Evaluation 

%% Part 1:
clear

% For the case where R = 100Ohm, C = 6.8nF and L=10mH
R = 100;
C = 6.8E-9;
L = 10E-3;

zeta = R/2 * sqrt(C/L); % approximately 0.0412, so underdamped
w_n = 1/sqrt(L*C);
w_d = w_n * sqrt(1 - zeta^2);

% We know that the circuit is underdamped because zeta < 1

% We obtained C1 = -1, C2 = -(w_n/w_d) * zeta
C1 = -1;
C2 = -(w_n/w_d) * zeta;

t = 0:1E-6:1E-3;
y = exp(-zeta * w_n .* t) .* (C1*cos(w_d.*t) + C2 * sin(w_d.*t)) + 1;
plot(t, y, 'red');

hold on

%% Critically damped

% For the critically damped case:
R = 2 * (1 / sqrt(C/L));
zeta = R/2 * sqrt(C/L);
w_n = 1/sqrt(L*C);

% We obtained that C1 = -1, and C2 = -w_n.
C2 = 0;
C1 = -1;
